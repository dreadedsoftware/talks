# Python is not just a worse version of Java with strong, dynamic types
# Python is one of the best choices for `mainstream` FP
# functional values, free monoid, fold, lambdas, strong types
# decorators are Python's "implicit" keyword allowing one to perform semi-automatic compositions
# This is one encoding of typeclasses. It is a little bit bulky, but workable.
# Hopefully, someone who actually knows python can make suggestions.
